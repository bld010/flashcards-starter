## Setup

Clone the repo. 
```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm test` in your terminal. You should have 5 pending tests in your `Card` test file that show up.

Running `node index.js` from the root of your project should result in the following message being displayed in your terminal: 

```bash
Node server running on port 3000
```
